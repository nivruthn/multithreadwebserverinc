This package includes three files:
1. myhttpd.c
2. Makefile
3. README.txt

HOW TO COMPILE
You can simply type "make" in the source code directory 
and it would generate two new files: myhttpd.o and myhttpd.

HOW TO RUN THE SERVER
You can type "./myhttpd -d" in the source code directory 
to run the server in the debugging mode.
If you do not type "-r root directory", then the root 
directory is where the server is running.
The log file will be saved in the root directory. You have
to type the name of log file, for example, "-l logfile.txt".
